A third-culture kid with interests in languages, UX and accessibility. I swear fluently in 4 human languages and happily in 3 more, and thought I could add the knowledge of computer languages to the mix. I have worked in E-Commerce on the marketing and product side for years, and am looking to widen my skills portfolio to become a confident full-stack developer through Makers Academy's 12-week bootcamp.

I am looking to work in a responsible and responsive organisation with dynamic, exciting projects.

## Skills

#### Communication

I am proud of my ability to communicate with and to various audiences. Whether in written form or in presentations, I am a confident and persuasive communicator. I have significant experience in electronic marketing as well as acedemic writing.

- I wrote the electronic marketing materials for the e-commerce operation of BrewDog, Britain's largest and fastest-growing craft brewer, helping to double online sales in 12 months.
- I have run beer tasting events for a variety of audiences, fine-tuning my presentation and detail level to the audience's specifications (few people on a work Christmas do care about the particular shade of crystallized malt used in a beer!)
- At university, I produced and ran a radio show that was streamed and distributed as a podcast, earning a shortlist for a college radio award. 
- My most recent blog-type writing, documenting my journey with Makers, can be found at https://medium.com/@kaipmdh

#### Problem Solving

I am a systematic and creative problem solver, with experience dealing with hardware and software issues in first- and second-line support as well as in busy hospitality situations.

- I managed a project to improve wireless network access on campus with 150 new access points installed or upgraded with no down time experienced by users.
- I have extensive cellar experience, solving draught line issues under pressure in some of London's best craft beer bars.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies
| ---|---|---|
| [Das Zahlensender](https://twitter.com/daszahlensender) | Twitter bot that functions as a very mysterious and totally not conspiratorial numbers station to practice implementation of a Ruby app to Heroku. | Ruby, oAuth, Twitter API, Heroku |

## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2018 - March 2019 (expected))

- Curious and passionate about code: Before the start of the main part of the course, I taught myself Rails and oAuth through creating a Twitter bot, a numbers station-like program that procedurally generates numbers and tweets them out. I aim to update this with natural language processing (NLP) to scramble actual tweets from specified users and tweet them out in code.
- Fast, independent learner: With only 12 weeks of the on-site portion of the course, students must quickly gather information, determine what is relevant for the problem required and make use of these technologies and tools immediately to produce vbiable code in very short timescales.
- Great collaborator: Makers Academy emphasises pair programming and working in small agile teams to enhance productivity.

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### King's College London, MA Geopolitics Territory and Security (2011 - 2012)

- Dissertation focused on the geopolitics of natural resources in Polar regions.
- Specialised in maritime dispute resolution, territorial disputes and the politics of natural gas transport into Europe.
- Passed With Distinction
- During my time at King's, I ran a regular metal music show on the college radio network that got shortlisted for a student radio award

#### London School of Economics, BSc Environmental Policy (2006 - 2009)

- First Class Honours
- Courses in environmental economics, environmental analysis and assessment, environmental politics and policy, international political theory and European Union policymaking

#### Certified Cicerone® (2014)

- Certified Cicerone is the second level of the Cicerone certification of beer professionals. Those who achieve this certification have a solid and well-rounded knowledge of beer and beer service as well as basic competence in assessing beer quality and identity by taste. The four-hour exam includes written, tasting, and demonstration portions.
- In the years since its founding, the Cicerone® Certification Program has become the industry standard for identifying those with significant knowledge and professional skills in beer sales and service.
