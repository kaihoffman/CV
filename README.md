A third-culture kid with interests in languages, UX and accessibility. I swear fluently in 4 human languages and happily in 3 more, and thought I could add the knowledge of computer languages to the mix. I have worked in E-Commerce on the marketing and product side for years, and am looking to widen my skills portfolio to become a confident full-stack developer through Makers Academy's 12-week bootcamp.

I am looking to work in a responsible and responsive organisation with dynamic, exciting projects.

## Skills

#### Communication

I am proud of my ability to communicate with and to various audiences. Whether in written form or in presentations, I am a confident and persuasive communicator. I have significant experience in electronic marketing as well as acedemic writing.

- I wrote the electronic marketing materials for the e-commerce operation of BrewDog, Britain's largest and fastest-growing craft brewer, helping to double online sales in 12 months.
- I have run beer tasting events for a variety of audiences, fine-tuning my presentation and detail level to the audience's specifications (few people on a work Christmas do care about the particular shade of crystallized malt used in a beer!)
- At university, I produced and ran a radio show that was streamed and distributed as a podcast, earning a shortlist for a college radio award. 
- My most recent blog-type writing, documenting my journey with Makers, can be found at https://medium.com/@kaipmdh

#### Problem Solving

I am a systematic and creative problem solver, with experience dealing with hardware and software issues in first- and second-line support as well as in busy hospitality situations. I have further honed this skill during my time at Makers, which emphasises a strict process-oriented approach to problem solving, whether in software debugging or wider design.

- I managed a project to improve wireless network access on campus with 150 new access points installed or upgraded with no down time experienced by users.

- I have a robust process-oriented approach to solving code-based problems. I successfully implemented a test-first design of the continuous integration of a React app using Google Firebase, both new technologies to me at the time.

#### Agile Development / XP

I am a thorough Agile convert, especially of XP values. During my Makers course, I worked in small Agile teams on several projects, employing industry best practice. In the spirit of the XP value of feedback, I implemented a system of face to face feedback on pull requests in my teams, meaning everyone involved had ownership of the code and a sense of having contributed, even when they may have not written the feature itself.

- Daily standups with ticket estimation, leading to pair programming assignments for the tickets for the day.
- Short (due to the timeframe of our projects) 2-day sprints that culminated in team Retrospectives and review of progress
- Iterative development with continuous integration as soon as we had a viable product.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies Employed
| ---|---|---|
| [Das Zahlensender](https://twitter.com/daszahlensender) | Twitter bot that functions as a very mysterious and totally not conspiratorial numbers station to practice implementation of a Ruby app to Heroku. | Ruby, oAuth, Twitter API, Heroku |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/thielsen/acebook-rails-template) | Two-week project at Makers Academy to really hone in Agile methodologies through the creation of a Facebook-like CRUD app. | Rails, RSpec, Devise, CodeClimate, Travis CI, Heroku
| [Fashion Finder](https://github.com/rtfdm/fashion-finder) | Two-week Makers Academy final project, implementing an aspirational fashion e-commerce front-end | React, Firebase, Styled Components, Jest, Cypress, CodeClimate, Travis CI

## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2018 - March 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code: Before the start of the main part of the course, I taught myself the Twitter API and oAuth through creating a Twitter bot, a numbers station-like program that procedurally generates numbers and tweets them out. I aim to update this with natural language processing (NLP) to scramble actual tweets from specified users and tweet them out in code.
- Fast, independent learner: With only 12 weeks of the on-site portion of the course, students must quickly gather information, determine what is relevant for the problem required and make use of these technologies and tools immediately to produce vbiable code in very short timescales. For my team's final project we successfully deployed a React.js project with Styled Components and a Firebase database, all technologies independently learned during the project duration.
- Great collaborator: Makers Academy emphasises pair programming and working in small agile teams to enhance productivity. I have embraced Agile and XP through the course, and use my skills as a facilitator to bridge team specialities and personalities. 

Through the course I have covered the following:
- Agile/XP processes, Design-Driven Development
- OOP: Ruby, JavaScript, React.js, Python
- MVC: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra
- TDD: RSpec, Jasmine, Jest, Cypress, PyTest
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL
- CD/CI: Travis, Heroku
- Code management through git

#### King's College London, MA Geopolitics Territory and Security (2011 - 2012)

- Dissertation focused on the geopolitics of natural resources in Polar regions.
- Specialised in maritime dispute resolution, territorial disputes and the politics of natural gas transport into Europe.
- Passed With Distinction
- During my time at King's, I ran a regular metal music show on the college radio network that got shortlisted for a student radio award

#### London School of Economics, BSc Environmental Policy (2006 - 2009)

- First Class Honours
- Courses in environmental economics, environmental analysis and assessment, environmental politics and policy, international political theory and European Union policymaking

#### Certified Cicerone® (2014)

- Certified Cicerone is the second level of the Cicerone certification of beer professionals. Those who achieve this certification have a solid and well-rounded knowledge of beer and beer service as well as basic competence in assessing beer quality and identity by taste. The four-hour exam includes written, tasting, and demonstration portions.
- In the years since its founding, the Cicerone® Certification Program has become the industry standard for identifying those with significant knowledge and professional skills in beer sales and service.
